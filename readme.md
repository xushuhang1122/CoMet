# CoMet: Conversational Metaphor Chain for Social Deduction Games
![](docs/metaphor.png)

CoMet is a social deduction game framework based on large language models, focusing on the role of metaphorical thinking chains in game dialogue. This project implements a complete AI system for the "Who Is Undercover" game, supporting multiple reasoning modes, particularly cognitive reasoning mechanisms based on metaphors.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. API Configuration

Improve the interfaces within `utils.py` - implement large model calls through your own LLM API.

### 3. Run Game

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧠 CoMet Architecture Details

### FISA Four-Stage Reasoning Model

1. **Feature Analysis** - Feature extraction and analysis
   - Analyze core features and attributes of words
   - Identify descriptive keywords

2. **Identity Reasoning** - Identity reasoning and faction division
   - Reason other players' identities based on their speech
   - Dynamically update teammate/opponent judgments

3. **Strategy Selection** - Strategy formulation
   - Select optimal strategies based on role and game state
   - Civilian: identify undercover vs Undercover: hide identity

4. **Action Implementation** - Action execution
   - Generate speech content that aligns with strategy
   - Vote based on reasoning results

### Metaphor System

#### Three Metaphor Types
- **Ontological Metaphor**: Entity representation of abstract concepts
- **Structural Metaphor**: Understanding complex concepts through familiar structures
- **Spatial Metaphor**: Mapping abstract experiences through spatial relationships

#### Metaphor Evaluation Mechanism
- **Teammate Recognition**: Whether teammates can understand metaphorical expressions
- **Opponent Interference**: Whether opponents can guess answers through metaphors
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Success rate calculation based on usage effects

## 📊 Experience Management System

### Experience Pool Functions
- **Historical Records**: Save all metaphor usage cases and effects
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Categorized management by success rate, type, usage frequency
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Dynamically adjust weights based on game outcomes

### Evaluation Dimensions
```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "words": ["word1", "word2"],
  "metaphor": "metaphorical_expression",
  "method": "ONTOLOGICAL_METAPHOR",
  "teammate_recognitions": 1,  // Teammate recognition count
  "rival_recognitions": 0,      // Opponent recognition count
  "use": 0,                     // 0=success, 1=failure
  "score": 0.85                 // Success rate score
}
```

## 🎮 Game Flow

1. **Role Assignment**: System randomly assigns civilian and undercover roles
2. **Word Distribution**: Civilians receive the same word, undercovers receive similar words
3. **Speaking Phase**: Players take turns describing their words (metaphors allowed)
4. **Voting Phase**: Vote to eliminate suspicious players based on speech content
5. **Victory Determination**:
   - Civilian Victory: Eliminate all undercovers
   - Undercover Victory: Undercover count >= Civilian count

## 🌍️Related Work (Benchmark for Undercover)

We recommend you use our follow-up work [CK-Arena](https://CK-Arena.site) to conduct research on Undercover games. This is our LLM testing benchmark designed based on Undercover, which includes better game logic, anti-crash mechanisms, and prompts. We are still working on the follow-up work of undercover, mainly updating it on the CK-Arena homepage.
